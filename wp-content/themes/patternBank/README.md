# WPThemeBoilerPlate
A clean boilerplate for Wordpress

Designed to be a no fuss boilerplate - it has a simple, generic layout with straight forward code. There are js and php functions available to use, which are listed below.

This theme is designed to work with Advanced Custom Fields - though version 1.0 has no ACF dependencies.

In the box:

SASS:-
Normalizer - bit.ly/normalize-scss courtesy of JohnAlbin.<br>
Some basic tools in global.scss including a clearfix class (.cfx)

PHP

Custom paths - set these paths to your images/files as you see fit. Not essential, but can be useful.<br>

Excerpt and content functions that add functionality to the wordpress the_excerpt() and the_content() functions - specifically the ability to neatly truncate content.<br>
Emoji script removal - avoid console errors.

Javascript<br>

Script to avoid popup errors on browsers that don't have a console.<br>
